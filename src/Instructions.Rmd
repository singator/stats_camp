# Goals

In this exercise, we shall try to address the following questions by collecting 
data on ourselves:

1. Does resting heart rate differ according to gender, height and weight?
2. How much is heart rate affected by 
    * watching exciting sports?
    * working on a math problem?
3. How long does it take our heart rate to recover after moderate physical 
activity?

As you proceed through the activity, think about each step you are doing. The 
following questions may be interesting to ask at each stage:

* Why are we using *this* tool/program?
* What do I expect to see happen?
* What can I conclude from this output? Is the conclusion clear cut? Did I 
overlook any possibilities?

# Setting Up

At any point, if you need help, please raise your hand.

## Downloading What You Need

1. Log in to the PC in front of you. The user name (do not leave out the period and 
the backslash) and password are:
```
username:  .\statuser
password:  4ever!2much4me
```
2. Open up Internet Explorer, and go to this address:
```
http://sta93.stat.nus.edu.sg/stats_camp.zip
```
3. Extract the zipped file on to the Desktop. You should now have a folder 
containing the following items:
    1. hr2b.ino - a file to be loaded onto the Arduino.
    2. data_capture.ipynb - a Python notebook for data capture.
    3. stats_camp.mp4 - a video.
    4. math_problem.pdf - a mathematics problem for you to solve.

## Arduino

1. Make sure each pair of participants has the following items:
    * 1 x Arduino UNO
    * 1 x USB cable
    * 3 x male-male jumper cables
    * 1 x Heart rate sensor
2. Connect the Heart-rate sensor to the Arduino according to the following
diagram. The red cable should connect the the 5V power, black to the Ground pin,
and the yellow cable to PIN 2 on the right.

3. Connect the Arduino to one of the USB ports on the PC, and then double-click 
on the `hr2b.ino` program to open the Arduino IDE.
4. Once it is open, go to Tools > Port and select the COM port that your Arduino 
Uno is connected to. Write it down (e.g. COM4, or COM5 etc.) somewhere to 
remember it.
