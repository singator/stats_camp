This project was used in a 
[Statistics Enrichment Camp](http://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/opencms/events/outreach/camp.html) at NUS in June 2017. The participants were from various secondary schools and junior colleges in Singapore. 

For my activity, I intended to show them some of the considerations that a statistician has to make. Here's how the activity went:

1. At the beginning of the day, some students were randomly selected to perform a mock crime. They were pulled aside from the main group and asked to read through the following [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d1GxHHHfoRfWwDv_hTEXks6fbaj7GViHSbQsZgYy9iY/edit?usp=sharing). Some of them were assigned to the role of **truth-teller** and some to the role of **liar**.

2. Depending on their role, they were told to go into a room and perform the crime - either to remove a toy and hide it on their body (liar), or count the number of toys (truth-teller).

3. During the actual activity, these students were tested using a heart-rate recorder built using an Arduino. This was the [testing script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wWQ1hxm6_ACLKjNnEA5AtmuVctJOMqtFAFFEIASaKoU/edit?usp=sharing) that was read to them as part of the test.

4. Here is a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GG4-HKs0Lp4WevmfJyn8LojNKCEOp6sCupmX1RNBNcQ/edit?usp=sharing) that describes what happened. It can be used to brief the students just prior to the testing.

The overall purpose was to demonstrate 

This project was created to store the source code to record heartbeat through an Arduino. 
The device was then used as part of an activity to 
demonstrate the tasks that a statistician has to perform in order to be 
a good one.
