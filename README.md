This project was used in a 
[Statistics Enrichment Camp](http://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/opencms/events/outreach/camp.html) at NUS in June 2017. The participants were from various secondary schools and junior colleges in Singapore. 

For my activity, I intended to show them some of the considerations that a statistician has to make. Here's how the activity went:

1. At the beginning of the day, some students were randomly selected to perform a mock crime. They were pulled aside from the main group and asked to read through the following document.

The overall purpose was to demonstrate 

This project was created to store the source code to record heartbeat through an Arduino. 
The device was then used as part of an activity to 
demonstrate the tasks that a statistician has to perform in order to be 
a good one.
