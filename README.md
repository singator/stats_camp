This project was used in a 
(Statistics Enrichment Camp)[http://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/opencms/events/outreach/camp.html] at NUS.

This project was created to store the source code to record heartbeat through an Arduino. 
The device was then used as part of an activity to 
demonstrate the tasks that a statistician has to perform in order to be 
a good one.
